# outliers
Java API to identify outliers from a given set of data.

Curious about what outliers are - well, they are such dataset within any given data deviating away from the usual pattern to be considered not relevant - more info here,

PROJECT DETAILS:

- Maven project built in Java 11
- Restful API microservice

HOW TO TEST:

- Unzip given archive (or clone from https://github.com/kamranktech/outliers)
- Run "mvn clean install && mvn spring-boot:run" from project root (Alternatively, you can run AFApplication class)
- Use the postman collection (AF_Collection.postman_collection.json) placed in postman folder to test the outlier endpoint
- Few tests have been added too for users' convenience

Please feel free to correct me, suggest improvements or even make changes directly onto the given github repo.
